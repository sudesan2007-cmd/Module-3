# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## 🧾 Program
```x = ('1','8','n','5','9','p')
print('n' in x)
print('8' in x)
```

## Output

## Result
Thus a Python program that checks if the element 'n' and the element 8 exist within a given tuple is executed successfully.
